# Third party developer product bug reports
This repository provides a means for third party developers to report bugs – unexpected errors or flaws – related to Twitch developer products such as the API, Extensions, and PubSub. If you would like to report a bug for other Twitch products (e.g. creator dashboard, ads, broken pages), please file a [Twitch Support ticket](https://help.twitch.tv/s/contactsupport).

## Ask the community
Not sure if what you're seeing is a bug? Check with other members of the community! You can ask other developers about potential bugs or challenges with your development in the [forums](https://discuss.dev.twitch.tv) or on [Discord](https://link.twitch.tv/devchat).

## How to file a developer product bug
1. Make sure that the bug is affecting a third party developer product. If it's a general bug, please file a [Twitch Support ticket](https://help.twitch.tv/s/contactsupport).
2. Click the `Issues` tab above to get started, or go directly to [https://github.com/twitchdev/issues/issues](https://github.com/twitchdev/bugs/issues).
3. You will see a list of open issues. Review this list, or use the filters and labels to search for your bug in case it's already been reported. It may also have already been closed.
4. If the bug is not reported, click the green `New issue` button.
5. Find the applicable bug report template from this list and click the green `Get started` button. Choosing the right bug report template helps us route the issue to the appropriate product team.
6. Fill in the template with as much information as possible, and when completed, click the green `Submit new issue` button.

## An Experimental Beta Process
The use of GitHub issues for third party developer product bug reports is currently an experimental process. We believe it will help organize and track issues better in the short term for third parties developers, though we may evaluate a different approach for a long term solution.

We currently cannot provide a guarenteed time for response or resolution.

## Off-topic bug reports
Please note that we can only process bug reports related to third party developer products. Other reports will be closed and directed to file a [Twitch Support ticket](https://help.twitch.tv/s/contactsupport).
